    bio: `My journey in technology began about 5 years ago. At first, I thought about being a lawyer, journalist or civil engineer, areas for which I had a certain affinity and saw myself working professionally. While trying to decide, I wanted to find something to do in my free time that would also earn me some money. Thinking about problems I could solve or ideas I could sell, it came to mind to make websites but I had no idea how it worked

I wasn't the type of person who discovered programming because they edited HTML and CSS on Tumblr or decided to create a Minecraft server or any other game to play with friends (too bad), when I went to understand what it meant to make a simple website and program, I came across an entire universe, and in the end that's what intrigued me the most.

Academically, I started a degree in Science and Technology at the Federal University of Bahia, but soon migrated to Software Engineering. I still intend to do a few more things in this field, it's something I like, but let's see how life goes.

I really appreciate you getting here, let's exchange ideas!`,
