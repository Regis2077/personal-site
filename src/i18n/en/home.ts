    text: `To keep it short, here's a brief professional summary (which you can see in more detail on the [work](/work) page): Currently, I work as a Front-End Engineering Specialist. In my day-to-day, I alternate between building new features, solving problems, evolving existing projects, and implementing improvements focused on performance, SEO, and user experience. I mainly work on VTEX-based e-commerce projects, participating in the entire development cycle, from planning to delivery. This approach is interesting because it keeps me in constant contact with areas like backend and architecture, exploring the latest in technologies.

What I enjoy most about all of this is creating things together with other people, facing challenges in varied scenarios and contexts with different types of people. To give you an idea, most of the projects I've worked on involve clients from Latin America and Europe, so in my day-to-day I need to talk to people from various countries, discussing tasks, priorities, problems, and especially ideas. This gives me completely broad perspectives on everything around me!`,
