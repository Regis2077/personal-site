          describe: `Taking on this new position, I was able to integrate and assist in leading the development of Ongoing and Implementation projects, being an active part from the elaboration of MVPs for potential clients to the kickstarter, to make solutions and ideas possible. In my day-to-day, I am responsible for following the complete cycle of products and clients, from the initial kickstarter and scope analysis to execution, final validation and the go live of large projects. I actively participate in defining strategies and scope of demands, aligning expectations between team, stakeholders and clients. With this, I have the opportunity to analyze internal processes and propose improvements that optimize the workflow and make deliveries more efficient.

In my current team, I integrate a team with people from around the world. As a team, we build features, discuss solutions and share experiences, learning daily from the multiculturalism that this environment provides. Being with this team made me learn to act collaboratively and always ensure clarity in communication between different areas and cultures. Among the challenges is the coverage of major e-commerce events in Brazil and abroad. Intense experiences, but always full of learning and great results.

In addition to contributing technically, I have an active role in the evolution of the team, guiding new developers, doing code reviews and sharing learnings from our day-to-day.

Throughout this period, I had the chance to get involved in projects of different sizes and complexities and take on front-end, back-end and QA demands, which each day gives me a broader view of the entire web ecosystem. I have learned with each line of code how each technical decision can directly influence the product results and this experience has constantly improved me, making me an increasingly better engineer.`,

My routine followed agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, which enabled a clear organization of demands and a collaborative and predictable workflow.
